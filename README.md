# Data Analysis with Python
Data Analysis using Python and popular open-source libraries like pandas, scikit-learn and numpy and transform data into insights.

**We will work on how to:**

- Import data sets
- Clean and prepare data for analysis
- Manipulate pandas DataFrame
- Summarize data
- Build machine learning models using scikit-learn
- Build data pipelines

**It includes the following parts:**
**Data Analysis libraries:** 
- We will use Pandas DataFrames, Numpy multi-dimensional arrays, and SciPy libraries to work with various datasets.
- Pandas, an open-source library, and we will use it to load, manipulate, analyze, and visualize cool datasets.
- Another open-source library, scikit-learn, and we will use some of its machine learning algorithms to build smart models and make cool predictions.
